**ItemPress-develop** is the development repo for the [ItemPress Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/itempress/) on WordPress.org.

## Getting Involved

**Bugs** and **new features suggestions** are all initially filed on the WordPress.org [Support Tab](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/itempress). They are then automatically pushed to the [ItemPress Development Board](https://trello.com/b/OrTYa3Bp/itempress-development-board) on Trello where things get organized.

I want getting support and tracking development for ItemPress to be as easy as possible, so please use the [Support Tab](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/itempress) to:

- Report bugs
- Contribute patches, etc
- Suggest new ideas & features
- Get general support (try IRC first)

The [Support Tab](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/itempress) is the best way of getting in contact with me!

### IRC

**#itempress** is an official channel on freenode. Join there to get help, discuss new features, or just say Hi. I am usually there Mon-Fri 10am - 4pm MST-Arizona. Ping my username @aubreypwd to get my attention. Some official meetings will happen there in the future.

## Documentation

I am currently working on ItemPress's documentation on the [ItemPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=User:Aubreypwd/itempress)
