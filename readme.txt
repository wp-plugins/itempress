ItemPress is simply a robust custom post type that works with your current theme and is aimed to help you create content with the freedom of ambiguity.

== Description ==

ItemPress is simply a robust custom post type that works with your current theme and is aimed to help you create posts with the freedom of ambiguity and without infiltrating posts or pages. It has the power to create and organize lists, manage projects, or take notes all with the usual power of WordPress!

This is currently an alpha product and, if you are interested, you can help me out by installing and using the product, then visiting my ItemPress collection at http://aubreypwd.com/items-labeled/itempress/ and giving feedback!

ItemPress is being developed primarily at http://bitbucket.org/aubreypwd/itempress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What Can I do with ItemPress**

WordPress gives you a lot of power by letting you create public, private, and protected content with formatted text, images, as well as what plugins give you. ItemPress aims to let you do more than Blog or make pages. This let's you create content, organize it, all with the power of WordPress.

Just like WordPress posts and pages, you can organize them using tags (what ItemPress calls labels). Labels are very powerful, you can create groups of items using them.

ItemPress aims to let you make posts without any pre-determined meaning other than they aren't post and aren't pages. You give them the meaning.

**What are Associations?**

They are a way of assigning items to people, groups, etc without cluttering your labels. All users are automatically set with an association that starts with an @. This means can group together items that could be assigned to @user, and they can find them easily, again without cluttering up your labels.

**What gave you the idea?**

I've use a lot of things to create and organize content, like Trello, Evernote, and and P2, just to name a few. One day, while adding a note to Evernote, I though that WordPress could do this better. But I didn't want to just make a note taking plugin, I wanted to create content free from any kind of pre-determined types.

I felt I only needed a few things to do what I do on so many different platforms:

- Create content
- Create lists or groups of content
- Share content
- Protect my content with passwords, or make them private to myself
- Be able to style and change what these items look like
- Collaborate on content
- Extend what content I can make
- Assign people or groups to content (like an issue tracker)

WordPress gives you all this and more! So, I created a way to add content easily the WordPress way that wouldn't get in the way of posts or pages.
